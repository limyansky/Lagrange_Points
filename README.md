# Lagrange Points: Developing an Intuition

Twice now, I've found myself in discussions with my non-physics friends about the Lagrange Points. Although I know I derived them in grad school, I realized that I no longer remembered how to explain them. This repository attempts to remedy that by slowly building to the Lagrange points in an intuitive and visual manner.

## Lagrange Points in a Nutshell

When two bodies in space orbit one-another, there exist special equilibrium points around them where small satellites will feel no net force. These locations are called Lagrange points, and they are essentially parking spots where satellites can stay in the same location relative to the two bodies without (in theory, at least) having to expend any fuel.

## Repository Contents

- Lagrange_Points.nb: A Mathematica notebook (as a binary file) walking through the creation of the lagrange points in the following steps:
	- Single-Body Gravitational Potential
	- Two-Body Gravitational Potential
	- Centrifugal Potential
	- Effective Potential = Two-Body Gravitational Potential + Centrifugal Potential
	- Calculating the Lagrange Points from the Effective Potential
- Lagrange_Points.pdf: A version of the Mathematica notebook you can read with your favorite PDF viewer

## Further Resources I've prepared
I've uploaded the notebook to [Mathematica Online](https://www.wolframcloud.com/env/everyonetookthegoodnames/Published/Lagrange_Points.nb)

I plan to write a blog post on this topic soon, with some nice animations! I will add a link to [Limyansky.com](limyansky.com) when its ready.
